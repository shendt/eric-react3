[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-gbxg4q)

Implement the following functionalities:

- All transactions are initially displayed inside the table in the order they are retrieved from the source. The source is passed down as `txns` prop to TransactionTable component in App.js.

- Picking the date from the date input and pressing the `Filter` button should display all the records for that date in the table. If no date is chosen, the `Filter` button should not do anything.

- Clicking on the `Amount ($)` table header should sort the records in ascending order of amount. The behavior is the same for multiple clicks on `Amount ($)`.

Each transaction object contains the following properties :

- `String` date: The date when the transaction took place in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
- `String` description: The description of the transaction.
- `Number` type: The type of transaction, where 0 denotes a credit transaction and 1 denotes a debit transaction.
- `Float` amount: The total amount of the transaction.
- `String` balance: The balance of the account after the transaction was completed, prefixed with a dollar sign ($).

```
